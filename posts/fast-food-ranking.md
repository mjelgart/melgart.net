I'm moving from Tennessee to the DC area this year so before I move, I'd like to make a personal fast food ranking at this point in my life. This is a mix of how good the food is, how reliable the food is, and how good the experience of eating there is. 

# S Tier
Firehouse Subs, Chick-fil-a
# A Tier
Zaxby's, Five Guys
# B Tier 
Cook Out, Bojangles, Chipotle
# C Tier
In-n-out Burger, McDonald's, Whataburger, Shake Shack
# F Tier
Burger King

Thank you. I will not be taking questions at this time.
