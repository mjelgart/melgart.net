I'm moving from Tennessee to the DC area this year so before I move, I'd like to make a personal fast food ranking at this point in my life. This is a mix of how good the food is, how reliable the food is, and how good the experience of eating there is. 

| Tier | Fast Food |
| ----------- | --------- |
| S     | Firehouse Subs, Chick-fil-a |
| A     | Zaxby's, Five Guys |
| B     | Cook Out, Bojangles, Chipotle |
| C     | In-n-out Burger, McDonald's, Whataburger, Shake Shack |
| F     | Burger King |





Thank you. I will not be taking questions at this time.
