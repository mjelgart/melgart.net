title: 'Moving the site to Github Pages and Nextjs'

I'm relaunching my personal site. I had been meaning to look for a better solution for some time. 

It's now hosted on melgart.net.
It's now using Github Pages instead of Wordpress.com where I was paying $50/year.
It's now built using code I wrote with Nextjs and markdown instead of a fullstack Wordpress install, which had been overkill for my needs for some time.
