I'm relaunching my personal site. I had been meaning to look for a better solution for some time, as the old blog had a few issues. It didn't look great, since I was using the Wordpress personal hosting tier, which does not allow much CSS customization. Also while I had defintely saved some money by switching from a fully self-hosted install at an overpriced hosting site to the personal Wordpress.com tier, I was still paying $50 a year. While not a ton of money, it seemed ridiculous to be a real coder but then pay someone else to host my site with a CMS with a bunch of advanced features locked behind higher price tiers when I could just write the code directly. 

Given this problem and the desire to fix it, I took on this mini-project and have decided to document it here.

It's a pretty solid answer. I had heard of Github Pages before and figured I'll just go check it out given it's free anyway, and I'd be using GitHub to host my code. 

# React Frameworks

It had been a while since I'd worked on a small and simple React project. I initially reached for 

It's now hosted on melgart.net.

It's now using Github Pages instead of Wordpress.com where I was paying $50/year.

It's now built using code I wrote with Nextjs and markdown instead of a fullstack Wordpress install, which had been overkill for my needs for some time.
