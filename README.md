# melgart.net

This is the repo for my personal site. 

# Initializing

When starting a new codespace, make sure to run `npm install`

# Developing

When developing, use `npm run dev`

I recommend creating a codespace and working in VS Code. 

All commits to the main branch are automatically built and pushed to production which you can find at [melgart.net](https://melgart.net).
